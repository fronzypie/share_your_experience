## üéØ HOW TO TEST THE APPLICATION

### **Step-by-Step Testing Guide:**

1. **Visit the Application:**
   - Open: https://darling-axolotl-ce4cbd.netlify.app

2. **Register a New Account:**
   - Click "Don't have an account? Sign Up"
   - Enter username and password (minimum 6 characters)
   - Click "Register"

3. **Create an Experience:**
   - Click the floating "Share Your Experience" button (bottom right)
   - Fill in all fields (notice the calculated "Timeline Days" field!)
   - Submit the form

4. **Test Search & Filter:**
   - Use the search bar to find specific experiences
   - Use the difficulty filter dropdown
   - Use the sort dropdown to reorder results

5. **Test CRUD Operations:**
   - **Read:** View all experiences in the list
   - **View Details:** Click any experience card
   - **Update:** Click the edit icon on your own posts
   - **Delete:** Click the delete icon on your own posts

6. **Test Pagination:**
   - Create 11+ experiences to see pagination
   - Use Next/Previous buttons

### **Important Note:**
The backend uses Render's free tier, which may sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first API request may take 30-60 seconds to wake up the server. This is normal for free tier hosting.
