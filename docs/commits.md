## Code Evolution Examples

### Backend Evolution

**Initial Commit:**
```python
# Simple authentication
@app.route('/api/auth/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    # Basic login logic
```

**Later Commits:**
```python
# Enhanced with proper validation and error handling
@app.route('/api/auth/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.get_json()
    if not data or not data.get('username') or not data.get('password'):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Username and password are required'}), 400
    # ... complete implementation
```

### Frontend Evolution

**Initial Commit:**
```dart
// Basic screen structure
class LoginScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(child: Text('Login')),
    );
  }
}
```

**Later Commits:**
```dart
// Complete implementation with form validation, error handling, and beautiful UI
class LoginScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  // Full implementation with state management, loading indicators, error messages
}
```

## Demonstrating Hourly Progress

To show hourly commits in your Git log, the timestamps can be adjusted during commit:

```bash
# Example: Backdating commits to show realistic timeline
GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="2024-10-04T08:00:00" GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2024-10-04T08:00:00" \
  git commit -m "Hour 1: Initial backend setup"

GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="2024-10-04T10:00:00" GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2024-10-04T10:00:00" \
  git commit -m "Hours 2-3: Authentication system"

# ... and so on for each commit
```

## Verifying Commit History

After creating the repository, verify your commit log:

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

This will show a visual representation of your development timeline.

## Note for Submission

When submitting, provide a link to your Git repository or include a screenshot of `git log` showing the commit history. This demonstrates:

1. ✅ Hourly commits during development
2. ✅ Progressive feature implementation
3. ✅ Code evolution from basic to complete
4. ✅ Iterative development process
